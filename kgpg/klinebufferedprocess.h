/**
 * Read output of a process split into lines
 *
 * This class reads the output of a process and splits it up into lines. This
 * is especially useful if you try to parse the output of a command line tool.
 *
 * \b Usage \n
 *
 * The class is created and set up like a KProcess. After this you can do
 * something like this:
 *
 * \code
 * connect(m_linebufprocess, SIGNAL(lineReadyStandardOutput()), SLOT(dataStdout()));
 * ...
 * void myobj::dataStdout()
 * {
 *   while (m_linebufprocess->hasLineStandardOutput()) {
 *     QByteArray line;
 *     m_linebufprocess->readLineStandardOutput(line);
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Never use the read functionality of KProcess with this class. This class
 * needs to read all data from the process into an internal buffer first. If
 * you try to use the read functions of the parent classes you would normally
 * get no output at all.
 *
 * The write functions of the parent classes are not effected. You can use
 * them exactly the same way as in KProcess.
